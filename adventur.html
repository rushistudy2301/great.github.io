Air-based: Sky diving/parachuting, paragliding, and parasailing. White water sports include rafting, kayaking, and canoeing on the water.Action sports, adventure sports or extreme sports are activities perceived as involving a high degree of risk.

            <h3 class="desc">BIKING</h3>
        </div>
            <P class="text">The Cambridge Dictionary defines extreme sports as, “A sport that is very dangerous and exciting.” I think mountain biking is enthralling whether it be in spite of or because of its risk. So to answer the question is Mountain Biking an Extreme Sport -Yes, mountain biking is considered an extreme sport.
                <br><br>
                Types of Mountain Biking:
While all types of mountain biking involve some degree of risk, some events or styles are inherently more dangerous than others. Let's delve into the types of mountain biking and analyze how each earns its way into the realm of extreme sports.

Red Bull Rampage: Red Bull Rampage might just be the most extreme of all forms of mountain biking. These types of tricks and courses cannot and should not be attempted by anyone other than a professional.
The Red Bull Rampage is a freeride type of mountain bike competition that takes place in Virgin, Utah. It is invitation only, and rightly so, because the riders will arrive in Utah with a crew and spend the days prior to the competition building their own routes down the face of the canyon.

            <P class="text">Paragliding is a recreational and competitive flying sport. It is a free-flying foot launched aircraft wherein a pilot sits in a harness suspended below a fabric wing.

                <br><br>
                Despite not using an engine, paraglider flights can last many hours and cover many hundreds of kilometres, though flights of one to two hours and covering some tens of kilometres are more the norm. By skillful exploitation of sources of lift, the pilot may gain height, often climbing to altitudes of a few thousand <br><br> <strong>History -</strong> &nbsp; In 1966, Canadian Domina Jalbert was granted a patent for a multi-cell wing type aerial device—"a wing having a flexible canopy constituting an upper skin and with a plurality of longitudinally extending ribs forming in effect a wing corresponding to an airplane wing airfoil ... More particularly the invention contemplates the provision of a wing of rectangular or other shape having a canopy or top skin and a lower spaced apart bottom skin", a governable gliding parachute with multi-cells and controls for glide.

Like snowboarding, surfing is a board sport, in which the surfer stands up and rides a surfboard propelled by the forward motion of a wave
                <br><br>
                Surfing is a popular extreme sport. The sport was integral to ancient Polynesian culture and was likely first seen by western eyes when British explorers visited Tahiti in 1767. Surfing was also common in Hawaii when Captain James Cook visited the island (and was killed there) in the late 18th century.The sport gradually spread to the west coast of North America over the next hundred years, first in California and later to the rest of North America.Fast forward to now and surfing is widely enjoyed and practiced throughout the United States and Australia, among other places. But let's not exclude Canada from that list. Tofino, on the west coast of Vancouver Island, is a popular surfing town here in the Great White North. Way back in 2010, when I sucked at blogging, the little community was even called 'The Best Surfing Town in North America'.

            <h3 class="desc">Rock climbing</h3>
    </div>
    <P class="text">Rock climbing is a sport in which participants climb up, across, or down natural rock formations. The goal is to reach the summit of a formation or the endpoint of a usually pre-defined route without falling. Rock climbing can burn between anywhere from 500 to as much as 900 calories per hour. Not only that, but it can drive some great changes in your body composition, leading to more lean muscle mass. The first artificial wall known to have been created was the Schurman Rock.
        <br><br>
        Rock climbing is the process of ascending cliffs. It involves following certain routes on a rock face requiring the use of naturally formed handholds and footholds and uses specialised equipment as a backup safety system. These guidelines apply to rock climbing on natural rock cliffs, not on artificial structures.
